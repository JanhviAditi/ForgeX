## üìä Model Performance

### Training Metrics
- **Training Accuracy**: 76.94%
- **Testing Accuracy**: 45.02%
- **Model Type**: Random Forest (100 trees, max_depth=20)

### Classification Report
```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support
   Authentic       0.60      0.58      0.59       200
      Forged       0.14      0.15      0.15        91
    accuracy                           0.45       291
```

### Confusion Matrix
```
[[117  83]     Authentic: 117 correct, 83 misclassified
 [ 77  14]]    Forged: 14 correct, 77 misclassified
```

## üîç Analysis

### Why is Test Accuracy Low?

1. **Dataset Limitation**: The Roboflow dataset was originally for object detection (locating Aadhaar cards), NOT forgery detection
   - All images are legitimate Aadhaar cards
   - "Forged" class was created from augmented images (blur, resize, contrast)
   - These augmentations don't represent real document forgeries

2. **Class Imbalance**: 
   - Authentic: 1,000 images
   - Forged: 453 images (only 31% of dataset)

3. **Weak Forgery Simulation**:
   - Roboflow augmentations (blur, scale, hue adjustment) are preprocessing steps
   - Real forgeries involve copy-paste, splicing, text manipulation, etc.

### Model Overfitting
- Training accuracy (76.94%) >> Testing accuracy (45.02%)
- Model memorized training augmentation patterns but doesn't generalize
- The forged class has very low recall (0.15) - model rarely detects forged documents

## üìÅ Output Files

### Models
- `models/random_forest_model.joblib` - Trained Random Forest classifier
- `models/scaler.joblib` - StandardScaler for feature normalization

### Data
- `data/raw/authentic/` - 1,890 original Aadhaar images
- `data/raw/forged/` - 480 augmented images
- `data/processed/train/` - Training set with augmentation
- `data/processed/val/` - Validation set
- `data/processed/test/` - Test set
- `data/processed/features.csv` - Extracted features

## üéØ Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. Get a Proper Forgery Dataset
Find datasets with:
- Real document forgeries (not just augmentations)
- Copy-move detection examples
- Spliced documents
- Text/signature forgeries

**Suggested datasets:**
- CASIA v1/v2 (Image Tampering Detection)
- Columbia Uncompressed Image Splicing Detection
- MICC-F220/600 (Copy-Move Forgery)

### 2. Create Synthetic Forgeries
Implement realistic forgery simulation:
```python
- Copy-paste manipulations
- Clone stamp operations
- Text region swapping
- Signature replacements
- Metadata tampering
```

### 3. Improve Features
Add more sophisticated features:
- SIFT/SURF keypoint matching
- Error Level Analysis (ELA)
- JPEG compression artifacts
- Noise pattern analysis
- Local Binary Patterns (LBP)

### 4. Try Deep Learning
The project includes deep learning models:
```bash
# CNN approach
python cli.py train-model data/processed/ --model-type cnn --epochs 50

# Transfer learning with pre-trained models
python cli.py train-model data/processed/ --model-type transfer_learning --epochs 30
```

Deep learning can automatically learn forgery patterns from images.

## üöÄ How to Use the Trained Model

### Make Predictions
```bash
# On a single image
python cli.py predict models/random_forest_model.joblib path/to/image.jpg

# On a directory
python cli.py predict models/random_forest_model.joblib data/test/ --output results.csv

# With visualization
python cli.py predict models/random_forest_model.joblib test_image.jpg --visualize
```

### Evaluate on Test Set
```bash
python cli.py evaluate models/random_forest_model.joblib data/processed/test/
```
